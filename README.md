1.Data Preprocessing

Handling Missing Data: Fill or drop missing values in datasets (e.g., missing athlete information).
Standardization: Normalize numerical data like age, height, and weight for better comparisons.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categories (e.g., gender, country) into numerical values for analysis.
Descriptive Statistics

2. Basic Insights:
Mean, median, mode, and distribution of age, weight, and height of athletes.
Count of medals by countries, gender, and events.
Visualizations:
Bar Charts: Medal distribution by country.
Histograms: Age or height distribution of athletes.
Pie Charts: Gender representation across events.
Trend Analysis

3.Time Series Analysis: Analyze how medal counts change over different Olympic years using line plots.
Rolling Averages: Identify trends in performance for specific countries or athletes.
Growth Rate Calculations: Measure performance growth of countries over time.
Correlation and Relationships

4.Scatter Plots: Relationship between age, height, and medal wins.
Heatmaps: Correlation between variables like GDP, population, and medal counts.
Pivot Tables: Aggregate data for medal distribution by year, sport, and gender.
Comparative Analysis

5. Grouped Bar Charts: Compare performance of top 10 countries across multiple Olympics.
Box Plots: Distribution of athlete ages by sport.
Stacked Bar Charts: Medal types (gold, silver, bronze) for countries.
Cluster Analysis

6.K-Means Clustering: Group countries based on performance metrics (medal counts, population, GDP).
Hierarchical Clustering: Categorize sports based on participation patterns.
Predictive Modeling

7.Linear Regression: Predict medal counts based on variables like GDP, population, and training investment.
8.Logistic Regression: Predict likelihood of winning a medal based on athlete attributes.
9.Decision Trees/Random Forest: Analyze factors influencing medal wins.
10.Performance Analysis by Events and Sports
